# Summary 
This academic project is a full-stack web application with an architecture pattern that separates the front-end and the back-end.  
- The front-end is a single-page client application using Angular, HTML and TypeScript.  
- The back-end is built with Laravel, an open-source PHP web framework, which provides a backend rendering CMS and manages the MySQL Database. A restful API is created to send JSON file to the front-end.
