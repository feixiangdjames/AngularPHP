When the coastal yellow chanterelles are slimed up after a long rainy period, these white gems stand in the forest just waiting to be scooped up. It seems to me, given the preponderance of neatly sliced stalks littering the forests on the North Shore, that most folks are familiar with the Golden Chanterelle (Cantharellus formosus) but somehow less familiar with the White, Cantharellus Subalbidus variety. This is mostly due to the preference for subalbidus to grow in old growth forests, forming a micorrhizal relationship with conifers, predominantly Douglas Fir.',
